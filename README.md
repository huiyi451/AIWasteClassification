# Waste Classification Model

## Overview

This project utilizes a dataset from Kaggle containing tens of thousands of images categorized as organic and recyclable waste.

## Data Preparation

After initial exploration and preparation, 20,000 training and 1,000 testing images were selected.

## Model Development

The model development employs Google Teachable Machine with a pretrained MobileNet architecture, trained using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Evaluation

Evaluation involves testing images and calculating accuracy and confidence scores to assess model performance in waste classification.
